title: Updating Next.js to v13
description: How this blog updates Next.js from v12 to v13

## Introduction

This blog has been using Next.js v12 for a while. Since its v13 of the `page` directory has been stable in production, I decided to update.  
Not only I updated Next.js to v13, but I also fixed errors from other libraries.
This is why I want to take a note about that.

## Pull Request

[This PR](https://github.com/tkeiyama/thomathings/pull/28) commits this update.

## Updated Libraries

```diff
next
- 12.0.10
+ 13.2.4

+ 18.2.0

react-dom

+ 9.2.1

next-pwa

+ 5.6.0

eslint-config-next
- 12.0.10
+ 13.2.4
```

## What I did

### Remove anchor element which a child of the Link component

Since Next.js v13 changes the APIs of the Link component, the Link no longer needs an anchor element for a child.

> Warning: passHref is missing. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/link-passhref @next/next/link-passhref

If you use v12 of `eslint-config-next`, ESLint shows you the above warning unless you update it to v13

### Updating `mdx-bundler` to latest

> Error: Package subpath './jsx-runtime.js' is not defined by "exports" in /path/to/repo/node_modules/react/package.json

When I updated `next` to v13 and executed `next dev`, dynamic pages show the above error.
I guessed this error is from `esbuild` because I often saw the file `jsx-runtime.js` in projects using `esbuild` as the build output. `mdx-bundler` is only the package using `esbuild` in this blog. So I just updated it to latest, then it fixed the error.

I think `mdx-bundler` fixed this at [v8.1.0](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler/releases/tag/v8.1.0) which supports react v18.

## Other Topics

### Why not [appDir](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)?

Although I love using the `appDir` approach, the reason I didn't use in this blog is that I couldn't find a way I make MDX using react hooks shown on the client side.
I think I could do it with a combo of `useEffect` and `useState`, but it seems its implementation makes UX worse.

I also tried an approach that I pass the MDX content, which is serialized from a library such as `next-mdx-remote`, from the server component to the client component.
Because of [the serialization issue](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#passing-props-from-server-to-client-components-serialization), I couldn't do that.

If I find a good solution for the MDX content, I'll make this blog move to `appDir`!

### Why not [Astro](https://astro.build/)?

I've heard Astro is way too good for a static site. It often is compared to Next.js because they have similar features.  
The reason I stick with Next.js is the user experience of the page navigation.  
When a page moves to another page, users need to wait for the moment. Because of prerendering, Next.js doesn't make it happen.  
So I didn't move to Astro this time.
