## Motivation

There've been lots of useful things that I'd like to remember/share.  
But every time I forget to take a note of those, and one of the reasons for that is that I don't have a place to note.
So I've decided to make here to store things roughtly.

## Disclaimer

- All things here are just my opnions.

### Generic Types for a React component

```

### Getting a type in parameters of a function.

You can use an unexported type from a module/library.

```tsx
// A function
function doSomething(a: number, b: string) {
  // Something
}

// Getting the type of `a` in the Foo function
type Foo = Parameters<typeof doSomething>["0"];
```

### Cursor for a Help icon.

<CursorForAHelpIcon.SampleHelpIcon />

The Help icon usually shows users a helpful message by a user action.  
There are 2 following user actions. And I'm going to describe how the cursor should be on each action.

- Mouse Over (Mouse Hover) <CursorForAHelpIcon.HoverableHelpIcon />

The cursor: `default` or `help`.

There are no user action, except `Mouse Hover`.  
The `help` cursor might be better because users can notice that there is something when the cursor changes.

- Mouse Click <CursorForAHelpIcon.ClickableHelpIcon />

The cursor: `pointer`

Users think its icon is clickable when the cursor is changed to the `pointer` icon.
