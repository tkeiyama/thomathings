## Motivation

There've been lots of useful things that I'd like to remember/share.  
But every time I forget to take a note of those, and one of the reasons for that is that I don't have a place to note.
So I've decided to make here to store things roughtly.

## Disclaimer

- All things here are just my opnions.

### Generic Types for a React component

```tsx
// Component
function Foo<T extends keyof SomeHtmlElements>(props: FooProps<T>) {
  // Something
}

// Usage
<Foo<"a"> href="somewhere" />;
```

### Getting a type in parameters of a function.

You can use an unexported type from a module/library.

```tsx
// A function
function doSomething(a: number, b: string) {
  // Something
}

// Getting the type of `a` in the Foo function
type Foo = Parameters<typeof doSomething>["0"];
```

  (Hovering the icon for about 1 second to see a help message.)
</p>

The Help icon usually shows users a helpful message when a cursor is hovering on it.  
While hovering, the cursor should be the default cursor because it doesn't do anytning even if it's clicked. The help cursor is acceptable.  
This shouldn't be others such as the click cursor because it's not clickable. Users might be confused to handle the icon.
